Academic success is a priority for students, faculty, and administration alike, and identifying students who may struggle can have a transformative impact. Since many factors can influence whether a student passes or fails, I decided to build a model to predict student performance based on some of the most relevant indicators. This model could provide early insights into student progress, helping educators and administrators offer timely interventions—such as tutoring, counseling, or customized learning plans—to improve the likelihood of course completion and support academic success.

This data set has around <b>40,000 rows</b> and <b>7 variables</b>: 2 boolean, 2 string, and 3 decimal
    <ul>
        <li>The booleans include participation in extracurricular activities and passed.</li>
        <li>The strings include student ID and parent education level.</li>
        <li>The decimals include study hours per week, attendance rate and previous grades.</li>
    </ul>

From the data, the dependent variable (y) we are trying to predict is `Passed`, and the rest are feature variables.
